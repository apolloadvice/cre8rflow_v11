Note: As of 2024-06-10, the core data model (timeline, tracks, clips, effects, transitions) is robust, extensible, and fully tested. Compound/nested clips are supported, and all timeline operations (trim, join, remove, move, transitions) work recursively. Serialization/deserialization is robust and versioned.

# TODO (2024-06-10):
- Enhance command parser and executor for extensibility (easy addition of new command types, effects, transitions)
- Add support for advanced/nested command parsing (e.g., group/compound operations, batch edits)
- Improve natural language flexibility and context understanding
- Address current user-facing limitations:
    - No group/compound operations (e.g., "cut all clips at 30s")
    - Limited natural language flexibility (commands must follow specific patterns)
    - No support for referencing clips by content or position
    - No custom effect/transition creation via natural language
    - Limited error recovery and suggestions

## 10. Parser/Executor Extensibility & Advanced Commands

- [x] Add preposition flexibility for OVERLAY (e.g., support both 'at the' and 'in')
- [x] Add context awareness for TRIM and CUT commands (2024-06-13)
- [x] Add context awareness for all major commands (CUT, TRIM, JOIN, OVERLAY, FADE, ADD_TEXT) (2024-06-13)
- [ ] Add context awareness for future commands (e.g., 'move that to the end', 'duplicate it', 'delete that', 'replace this with ...') — To be implemented when these commands are added
- [x] Support natural time expressions (e.g., 'thirty seconds', 'halfway through', 'the last 5 seconds') (2024-06-13)
- [x] Support combined commands (e.g., 'cut at 00:30 and join with clip2', 'trim the start and add a fade in') (2024-06-13)
    - Parser robustly distinguishes between true combined commands and single JOIN/MERGE/COMBINE commands.
    - All tests pass for both combined and single-command parsing.
- [x] **[Experimental] Integrate LLM (GPT) for NLP command parsing** (2024-06-14)

    - Note: All features implemented and tested. See README for usage and test details.
Note: As of 2024-06-13, context awareness for TRIM and CUT is implemented and tested. Remaining: context awareness for other commands, natural time expressions, combined commands, and LLM integration.

### 10.4 Move Command Support
- [ ] Implement MOVE command (context-aware, natural language, timeline operation)
    - Support moving clips between tracks and positions
    - Allow context-aware references (e.g., 'move that to the end', 'move it to the next track')
    - Ensure recursive/nested timeline support
    - Add unit tests for MOVE command parsing and execution
    - Update documentation and examples

### 10.5 Refactor Time Normalization

  - Note: MVP is complete. Pipeline supports export, preview, crossfade transitions, and basic effects (brightness, text overlay), with tests. Advanced effects and multi-transition support are future work.
- [x] Implement export/render: convert timeline and operations to ffmpeg command(s) (2024-06-14)
- [x] Add support for audio, subtitle, and effect tracks in ffmpeg pipeline (effect tracks are now rendered, not just logged/skipped) (2024-06-14)
  - Note: Effect track support is now robust; timeline/range-based effects are supported and tested as of 2024-06-14.
- [x] Remove MoviePy as a core dependency (can be used optionally for prototyping or preview) (2024-06-14)
- [x] Implement preview generation: allow user to play the current timeline state in the UI (low-res/fast render, can use MoviePy or ffmpeg)
  - Note: Backend API is ready for frontend integration.
- [x] Ensure all timeline edits (command or manual) update the timeline data structure and are reflected in the UI (UI integration: placeholder for future implementation)
  - Note: A UI update placeholder callback is implemented in Timeline and tested. Actual UI integration will be done when the UI is built.
- [x] Design backend API for triggering preview and export from the timeline state
  - Note: Both preview and export endpoints are implemented, tested, and ready for frontend integration.
- [x] Test and validate ffmpeg-based export for all supported operations (cut, trim, join, transitions, text, etc.)
  - Note: All supported operations are covered by unit tests, including edge and failure cases.
- [x] Add unit and integration tests for preview and export (including edge/failure cases)
  - Note: All major and edge/failure cases are covered by tests, including transitions, effects, file validation, quality, and error handling.
- [x] Ensure extensibility: new operations (effects, transitions, etc.) can be added to the pipeline with minimal changes
  - Note: Both effects and transitions are now pluggable via handler registries, and extensibility is covered by tests.
- [x] Document the user flow: edit (command/manual) → timeline update → user-initiated preview → export
  - Note: A clear user flow section has been added to the README.md.
- [ ] [Placeholder] Integrate backend with timeline UI for real-time edit visualization and playback (to be implemented when UI is built)

- [x] Parser now robustly supports command synonyms/variations, natural references (contextual, relative, by start time), and preposition flexibility for OVERLAY. Comprehensive tests for all these features are implemented and passing. (2024-06-13)
- [ ] Context awareness for MOVE, DUPLICATE, DELETE, REPLACE, etc., will be required if/when those commands are implemented (2024-06-13)

### 12.8 Summary Table of Gaps and Required Actions
| Workflow Step         | Current State         | Required Action(s)                                      |
|---------------------- |----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Asset Upload          | UI exists, no metadata, not persistent | Add metadata extraction, persistent storage             |
| Timeline Placement    | UI exists, drag-and-drop incomplete   | Implement drag-and-drop, create clips with metadata     |
| NLP Command           | Input exists, parser basic            | Integrate robust NLP, map to timeline actions           |
| Processing Feedback   | None                 | Add "thinking" indicator, step-by-step feedback         |

## Discovered During Work
- Fixed asset duration logic to always use latest version if duplicates exist (2024-06-15)
- Robust handling of 'cut' commands (trim vs. gap) with LLM and backend logic (2024-06-15)
- Added/updated unit tests for all cut scenarios (2024-06-15)
- **Fixed Timeline Disappearing Issue (2024-12-19)**: Resolved critical bug where AI commands (like "add text") would completely clear the timeline. Issue was in `handleVideoProcessed` function which replaced all existing clips with a single processed video clip. Fixed to preserve timeline structure and only update video sources, plus improved AI command handling to prioritize timeline operations over processed video for better editing experience.
- **Fixed Track Assignment Bug (2025-01-24)**: Resolved critical bug where text elements of the same type were being placed on different tracks despite not overlapping in time. Issue was in `applyOperationsToTimeline` function where operation effect types ("textOverlay") were being passed to `findBestTrack` instead of final clip types ("text"), causing the track assignment logic to treat each new element as a different type. Fixed by determining final clip type before calling track assignment logic.
