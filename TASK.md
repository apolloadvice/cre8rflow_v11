## Discovered During Work

### 9. NLP Video Editor Core Implementation (2024-06-09)
- [x] Implement core command parser module (spaCy, regex, custom intent classification)
- [x] Create timeline data structure for non-destructive video/audio editing
- [x] Develop command-to-edit bridge for mapping parsed commands to timeline operations
- [x] Evaluate MoviePy, PyAV, and ffmpeg-python for video processing
- [x] Add demo script showing end-to-end flow
- [x] Add support for 'add text' commands with time and position extraction in CommandParser and demo (2024-06-09)
- [x] Fix regex to support full clip names and correct text extraction in CommandParser; all parser unit tests passing (2024-06-09)

# Note: As of 2024-06-10, the core data model (timeline, tracks, clips, effects, transitions) is robust, extensible, and fully tested. Compound/nested clips are supported, and all timeline operations (trim, join, remove, move, transitions) work recursively. Serialization/deserialization is robust and versioned.

# TODO (2024-06-10):
- Enhance command parser and executor for extensibility (easy addition of new command types, effects, transitions)
- Add support for advanced/nested command parsing (e.g., group/compound operations, batch edits)
- Improve natural language flexibility and context understanding
- Address current user-facing limitations:
    - No group/compound operations (e.g., "cut all clips at 30s")
    - Limited natural language flexibility (commands must follow specific patterns)
    - No support for referencing clips by content or position
    - No custom effect/transition creation via natural language
    - Limited error recovery and suggestions

## 10. Parser/Executor Extensibility & Advanced Commands

### 10.1 Extensible Architecture
- [x] Refactor command parser for plugin/extensible architecture (2024-06-11)
- [x] Refactor command executor for plugin/extensible architecture (2024-06-11)

### 10.2 Advanced/Nested Command Support
- [x] Add support for group/compound operations in parser (e.g., batch edits, "cut all clips at 30s") (2024-06-11)
- [x] Enhance executor to handle batch/group/compound commands (2024-06-11)
- [ ] Implement referencing by content/position (e.g., "last clip", "clip with music")

### 10.3 Natural Language Flexibility
- [x] Support command synonyms/variations (e.g., 'split', 'divide', 'slice' as synonyms for 'cut')
- [x] Add natural references (e.g., 'this clip', 'the clip before that one', 'the clip that starts at 00:15')
- [x] Add preposition flexibility for OVERLAY (e.g., support both 'at the' and 'in')
- [ ] Add context awareness (e.g., 'now trim it', 'move that to the end')
- [ ] Support natural time expressions (e.g., 'thirty seconds', 'halfway through', 'the last 5 seconds')
- [ ] Support combined commands (e.g., 'cut at 00:30 and join with clip2', 'trim the start and add a fade in')
- [ ] **[Experimental] Integrate LLM (GPT) for NLP command parsing**
    - [ ] Integrate OpenAI API for command parsing
    - [ ] Map LLM output to internal edit operations
    - [ ] Fallback to pattern-based parsing if LLM fails or is ambiguous
    - [ ] Test and validate LLM-based parsing for common and edge cases

# Note: As of 2024-06-11, all major command types (CUT, TRIM, JOIN, ADD_TEXT, OVERLAY, FADE) are now handled by plugin/handler classes in both the parser and executor. The system is ready for plugin/custom command support. Group/compound operations (e.g., group cut) are implemented and tested. Next: improve natural language flexibility, add referencing by content/position, and develop user-facing features (UI, undo/redo, timeline visualization, etc.).

### 10.4 Move Command Support
- [ ] Implement MOVE command (context-aware, natural language, timeline operation)
    - Support moving clips between tracks and positions
    - Allow context-aware references (e.g., 'move that to the end', 'move it to the next track')
    - Ensure recursive/nested timeline support
    - Add unit tests for MOVE command parsing and execution
    - Update documentation and examples

### 10.4 Refactor Time Normalization
- [ ] Refactor time normalization to occur in command handler parse methods, not in executor (2024-06-12)

### 11. Video Processing Backend
- [ ] Design and implement ffmpeg-based rendering pipeline for timeline export
- [ ] Implement export/render: convert timeline and operations to ffmpeg command(s)
- [ ] Remove MoviePy as a core dependency (can be used optionally for prototyping or preview)
- [ ] Add support for audio, subtitle, and effect tracks in ffmpeg pipeline
- [ ] Test and validate ffmpeg-based export for all supported operations (cut, trim, join, transitions, text, etc.)

- [x] Parser now robustly supports command synonyms/variations, natural references (contextual, relative, by start time), and preposition flexibility for OVERLAY. Comprehensive tests for all these features are implemented and passing. (2024-06-13)
