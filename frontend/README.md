## üìù How to Use Natural Language Video Editing Commands

You can control the video editor using natural language commands in the chat panel. Here's how to structure your input for best results:

### Supported Command Types & Examples

#### 1. **Cut**
- **Format:** `cut [first|last|clip N] clip at [time]`
- **Examples:**
  - `cut first clip at 00:05`
  - `cut last clip at 00:10`
  - `cut clip 2 at 00:15`

#### 2. **Trim**
- **Format:** `trim [first|last|clip N] clip [to|from] [time]`
- **Examples:**
  - `trim first clip to 00:10` (keeps only up to 10s)
  - `trim last clip from 00:05` (removes everything before 5s)
  - `trim clip 2 to 00:20`

#### 3. **Add Text Overlay**
- **Format:** `add text "[your text]" [at|from] [start time] [to [end time]]`
- **Examples:**

- You can also use `hh:mm:ss` for longer videos.

### üí° Tips for Best Results
- Be specific about which clip you want to edit (e.g., `first`, `last`, or `clip 2`).
- For overlays, make sure the asset name matches an uploaded or available image.
- If you make a mistake, use the Undo button or `undo` command.
- The timeline and preview will update instantly for supported commands.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- Only the above command formats are currently supported.
- More advanced commands (e.g., transitions, effects) may be added in the future.
