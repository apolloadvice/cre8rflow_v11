## üìù How to Use Natural Language Video Editing Commands (AI-Powered)

You can now control the video editor using **free-form, natural language commands** in the chat panel. The system is powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 (or similar), so you can type instructions as you would describe them to a person.

### How It Works
- Type any edit instruction in your own words. The AI will interpret your intent and apply the edit to the timeline.
- The backend validates and applies the edit, and the UI updates instantly.
- If your command is ambiguous or cannot be understood, you'll receive a helpful error or feedback message.

### Examples of Supported Commands
- "Cut out the part where the guy in the grey quarter zip is talking."
- "Add title text from 10 to 15 that says 'Welcome to the channel'."
- "Overlay the logo from 5s to 10s."
- "Trim the first 5 seconds."
- "Remove the intro."
- "Add text 'Subscribe!' at the bottom from 00:20 to 00:25."

### Tips for Best Results
- Be as descriptive as you like‚Äîno need to follow a strict format.
- You can reference times, clip content, or describe what you want to change.
- If the system needs clarification, it will ask or provide feedback.
- Undo/redo and command history are supported for all edits.

### Error Handling & Feedback
- If the AI cannot interpret your command, you'll get a clear error or suggestion to rephrase.
- All errors are handled gracefully, and you are guided to clarify as needed.

### Deprecated: Rigid Command Syntax
- The old rigid command formats (e.g., `cut [first|last|clip N] clip at [time]`) are no longer required.
- You can now use natural language for all editing commands.
